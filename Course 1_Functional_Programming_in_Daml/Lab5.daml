-- Problem statement 1 =======================================================================================================
-- ===========================================================================================================================
-- There is a list of tuples provided to you as shown below:

-- song = [("do", "a deer, a female deer"), ("re", "a drop of golden sun"), ("mi", "a name, I call myself"), ("fa", "a long long way to run")]
-- Each tuple has a note, e.g. 'do', and a meaning, 'a deer, a female deer'.

-- Given this data, write a script to extract the notes and meanings into two separate lists and print them first in the given order.

-- A sample output is as shown below:

-- Trace: 
--   ["do","re","mi","fa"]
--   ["a deer, a female deer","a drop of golden sun","a name, I call myself","a long long way to run"]
-- Hint:

-- You may find map function useful
testMap : Script()
testMap =
    let
        song = [("do", "a deer, a female deer"), ("re", "a drop of golden sun"), ("mi", "a name, I call myself"), ("fa", "a long long way to run")]
    -- map (\) song

-- Problem statement 2 =======================================================================================================
-- ===========================================================================================================================
-- This problem has two parts

-- Using the map function, write a function named multiTermFrequency that takes a Text, say x, and a list of Texts, say y, as input. It then returns a list of numbers with each number at index i representing the frequency of x in the i-th element in y.

-- Here is a script to test your function:

-- testMultiTermFrequency = script do 
--     let x = "hello"
--     let y = [ "hello from the other side I must have called a thousand times", 
--             "You say goodbye and I say hello hello hello",
--             "hello is it me youâ€™re looking for",
--             "hello hello is anyone home"
--             ]

--     debug $ multiTermFrequency x y
--     return()
-- It should produce the following output:

-- Trace: 
-- [0.0833333333,0.3333333333,0.1428571429,0.4]
-- Write the same function as above using foldr instead of map function

-- Hint:

-- If you did Lab2 where you wrote a function named termFrequency, then you should be able to reuse it here.
